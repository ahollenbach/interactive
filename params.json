{"name":"Interactive","tagline":"Live projection mapping audio and video performance","body":"Interactive is an experiment in projection mapping computer generated visuals and videos that respond to changes in music. The project is built in Processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nThis project has a few dependencies before we can get started.\r\n\r\nFirst, install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/?processing). This has been tested with Processing 2.2.1. \r\n\r\nOnce you install Processing, you need to install our custom fork of [SketchMapper](https://github.com/ahollenbach/sketch-mapper), which is a system that allows us to map our content (Processing sketches, video, images) to surfaces. The instructions for installation can be found in that repository.\r\n\r\nOnce SketchMapper is installed, (the ```target``` directory has been copied to your Processing library folder), we need to install [Generative Gestaltung](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/code#library), a library/series of beautiful visualizations that we're using (at least for testing). Download the _Generative Design Library_. You'll also need to grab a few of the dependencies. _ControlP5_ is already provided by SketchMapper, so don't install that, but _Geomerative_ and _treemap_ may be necessary, depending on the visualizations used. To install these libraries, drag them to ```<Processing_Directory>/libraries``` (as you did for SketchMapper).\r\n\r\nLastly, clone this repository.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\nSimply open SketchMapperMain and press play! To go full-screen, go to ```Menu > Sketch > Present```. To change the visualization, click on a quad surface and change the source file.\r\n\r\n## Adding visualizations\r\nAdding visualizations is simple. I recommend copying the format of the existing visualizations and starting from there. If you want a non-black background, be sure to establish it in ```setup()```, as establishing it in the ```draw()``` routine will overwrite the visualization every time (unless this is something you want to do). You also need to add your sketch to the list of possible sketches in [SketchMapperMain.pde](SketchMapperMain/SketchMapperMain.pde). Make sure to give it a human-readable name that will appear in the dropdown.\r\n\r\n## Team\r\nAndrew Hollenbach @ahollenbach\r\nIsaac Banner @ibanner56\r\nJanice Mok\r\nThomas Tikos-Kadji","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
